# connectfour-py
A simple Connect Four like game written in Python. Adapted from Keith Galli's video on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.

I learned Python in grad school, but haven't done anything with it since about 2008, so this is a bit of a refresher for me.
The initial commit is kind of gross (IMHO) and this repo has mainly been created to track my changes and enhancements as I
go along. This is also my first GH project, so please forgive my indiscretions at anything I'm doing 'wrong'. :)
