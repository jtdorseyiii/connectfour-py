# connectfour-py
A simple Connect Four like game written in Python. Adapted from Keith Galli's video on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel (https://youtu.be/XpYz-q1lxu8).

The initial commit differs slightly from Keith's example, as I made some 'editorial' decisions while coding along with the video... then again, that's the beautiful thing about code... you can sometimes achieve the same result in a variety of ways... it's all in how you look at it. Code == Art. :)

I learned Python in grad school, but haven't done anything with it since about 2008, so this is a bit of a refresher for me. The initial commit is kind of gross (IMHO) and this repo has mainly been created to track my changes and enhancements as I go along. This is also my first GH project, so please forgive my indiscretions at anything I'm doing 'wrong'. :)
